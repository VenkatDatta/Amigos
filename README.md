# Amigos

Amigos is a location based android service app. Basically people have trouble finding
places they want, when they enter an unknown area. For example finding a restaurant or a
friends house. This problem can be overcome by using our app. If any of your friends from
your contacts are present in the specified range , you can ask them the directions to the desired place you want to go in that area. Our app includes google maps, where the users friend can draw real-time sketches on the map to show the path where the user wants to go.
